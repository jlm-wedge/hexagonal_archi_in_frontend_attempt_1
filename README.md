# hexagonal_archi_in_frontend_attempt_1
Attempt to implement an hexagonal architecture in frontend using VueJs as a detail.

Starting from the example from Pierre Criulanscy here : https://github.com/PCreations/tdd-shopping-cart/tree/without-redux/src which uses React as a detail, this repository is an attempt to follow the same kind of architecture using VueJS instead of React.

It's an opportunity for me to implement for the first time the principles of the hexagonal architecture.

The first use case to implement is a simple one : "Retrieve a list of products to display"
